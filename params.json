{"name":"Schemaorg","tagline":"Schema.org - schemas and (appengine) software","body":"Welcome to Schema.org\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the Schema.org project repository. It contains all the schemas, examples and software use to publish schema.org. For the site itself, please see http://schema.org/ instead.\r\n\r\nIssues and proposals are managed here by participants of the W3C Schema.org Community Group.\r\nSee http://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg for the group. If you are interested to participate please\r\njoin the group at W3C, introduce yourself and find or file issues here that engage your interest. If you are new to Git and GitHub, there's a useful [introduction to Github](https://www.w3.org/2006/tools/wiki/Github) in the W3C Wiki.\r\n\r\nIssue #1 (https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1) in Github is an entry point for release planning. It \r\nshould provide an overview of upcoming work, in terms of broad themes, specific issues and release milestones.\r\n\r\nOur next milestone release has the working name 'sdo-ganymede'. See\r\nhttps://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/510 for an entry point, or else navigate issues via label or milestone withing Github. Every change to the site comes via discussions here. Substantive changes are recorded in our [release notes](http://schema.org/docs/releases.html). A preview of the [draft new release notes](http://sdo-ganymede.appspot.com/docs/releases.html#sdo-ganymede) can be found as part of the test site for our next release. Every month or so, after final review by the Schema.org Steering Group, we make a formal release. \r\n\r\nSoftware\r\n========\r\n\r\nFor most collaborators, all you need to know about the software is how to run it. Essentially you will need to have the Python version of Google App Engine SDK running on the platform of your choice. You can then make test builds of schema.org running on your own machine accessible as http://localhost:8080/ or else post them on appspot.com for collaboration. See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs for details. \r\n\r\nMore information about the software is also available in [SOFTWARE_README.md](SOFTWARE_README.md)\r\n\r\nSee also notes in the wiki: https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/wiki/Contributing\r\n\r\nFormats and standards\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nAll schemas and examples are in data/ in utf-8 encoded files.\r\n\r\nThe main schemas file is data/schema.rdfa (utf-8)\r\n\r\nWhile developing schemas, using data/sdo-somethinghere-schema.rdfa can be useful.\r\n\r\nThe format is based on W3C RDFS in HTML/RDFa format, see http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html\r\n\r\nThe examples are stored in data/examples.txt (utf-8) and other *.txt files.\r\n\r\nAs with schemas, data/*examples.txt will also be read. It can be useful to develop\r\nusing separate files. When vocabulary is finally integrated into the main repository, schema\r\ndata will be merged into schema.org. However examples will stay in separate files, as this\r\nworks better with git's file comparison machinery.\r\n\r\nThe data/releases/ hierarchy is reserved for release snapshots (see http://schema.org/version/).\r\n\r\nThe ext/*/ hierarchy is reserved for extensions (see http://schema.org/docs/extension.html).\r\n\r\n\r\nGithub Branch naming\r\n====================\r\n\r\nhttp://schema.org/docs/releases.html lists releases by working codename and release name.\r\n\r\nWe began using Ghostbusters character names (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters#Cast)\r\nsdo-stantz, sdo-venkman, sdo-stantz; inspired by http://schema.org/Role discussions.\r\n\r\ne.g. successor to http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v1.91 was code-named sdo-venkman, \r\nand eventually became http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v1.92\r\n\r\nYou can therefore see candidate draft release notes in the Git repository at docs/releases.html\r\n\r\nAs of May 2015, our next release will be called sdo-ganymede. The default branch in Github\r\nis named after the release. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon) ... subsequent names\r\nwill be in this general direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis documentation concerns the software codebase rather than schema.org itself. \r\n\r\nHowever do note that labels, comments, and documentation should use US English (in the code\r\nand schemas), if a choice between English variants is needed. Please aim for international \r\nEnglish wherever possible.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://twitter.com/schemaorg_dev\r\n# ## ### ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
